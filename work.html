          As a graduate teaching assistant, I supervise undergraduate chemistry laboratory classes. I am primarily responsible for ensuring that all my students adhere to university safety guidelines and established laboratory protocols. I support students in understanding experimental concepts, using routine laboratory instruments correctly, and documenting their work accurately.

          As a Volunteer Research Assistant in the Lawan Lab, I supported experimental studies focused on liver cancer signaling in mouse models. During my time here, I conducted Western blot analyses to compare protein expression between knockout and wild-type samples. I was also responsible for collecting tissue samples from sentinel mice in compliance with IACUC protocols.

          In the Baudry Lab at UAH, I was interested in examining how small molecules interact with biological targets. My role included reviewing peer-reviewed literature to evaluate potential targets, processing receptor structures on the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) for downstream docking studies, and keeping clear records of my workflows. Through my work here, I realized how computational chemistry is shaping today's drug discovery efforts by meticulously modeling the interaction of drugs and human receptors.

          In my role with the Academic Success Advocacy Program, I led targeted outreach initiatives to support undergraduate students and developed practical resources such as study guides and time-management tools. I also collaborated with the Student Success Center to design and distribute informational posters aimed at increasing awareness of available academic support services.
