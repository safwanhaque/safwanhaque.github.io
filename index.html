<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I am in pursuit of making a tangible difference in cancer therapeutics. This motivation comes from my firsthand experience 
with the drawbacks we face with current treatment options. It frankly baffles me that, in an age of remarkable scientific 
advances, we continue to be humbled by a disease as prevalent as cancer. And so, I submerge myself in the high seas of 
cancer chemistry. I want to work towards establishing avenues, especially in countries like my motherland Bangladesh, that 
make better cancer therapies accessible to the PEOPLE. Importantly, I promise to perpetually fight against ALL forces that 
aim to disrupt cancer research. My journey has just begun, and I am ready for the next big dive!
